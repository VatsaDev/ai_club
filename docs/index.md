# KU AI Club

KU AI Organization will be project-driven and members are encouraged to collaborate and share their knowledge of computer science, mathematics, engineering, finance, natural sciences, and any other relevant fields to develop projects of their choosing. 

In addition to providing a space to work on interesting AI/ ML projects with other students, this organization will provide opportunities to compete in machine learning competitions and find opportunities to learn more from an industry perspective through public webinars and speaker events. Depending on interest we will also host competitions with other clubs. 

Students of all expertise levels, majors, and years are welcome!
